# Kobe-Shot-Predictor Data Science Project

Using a dataset of 25000 of Kobe Bryant's recorded shots, I created a Machine Learning statistical Model that predicts, whether an
input, will be a miss or succesful shot attempt by Kobe bryant, with a 60% accuracy at the end. Documentation was done by Kurt.

We used Python libraries of numpy, Pandas, seaborn for visualization, sklearn, to analyze Kobe Bryant's data and build the model.

For non-technical people, the model presented in the video can be integrated with an application or maybe even a game, to simulate Kobe Bryant's shot attempts.
